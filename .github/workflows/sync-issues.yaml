concurrency:
  # If multiple issues are edited in quick succession, e.g. a PR closes multiple
  # issues, this workflow will be triggered once *per event*, e.g. 2 issues
  # closed = two workflow runs. In reality, we are interested in the most
  # recent event since all previous events will be caught by the API calls in
  # the script. Hence we use the concurrency of GitHub Actions to cancel in
  # progress runs and default to the latest run.
