# Outreachy organization repo for JupyterHub

This repository contains information about JupyterHub's
participation in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) - a
program that provides three-month internships for people from
groups traditionally underrepresented in tech.

This GitHub repository contains:

1. **Microtasks** for applicants to complete. These are small
   tasks that help the applicant familiarize themself with
   the project they are contributing to. These are accepted
   as GitHub issues.
2. Descriptions for various **Projects** that applicants can
   apply for. Maintainers can use this space to collaborate on
   keeping these descriptions up to date.
3. Project **Proposals** from applicants. These should be from
   a standard template that is maintained in this repository.
