# Cohort Calls

This section describes cohort calls, what they are, and how to run them. The
[Community Coordinator](comm-coord) holds responsibility for organising and
leading these calls. Therefore, it is at their descretion as to whether they
run these sessions or not. Reasons to not run these sessions may include time
constraints, or a small cohort.

## Motivation

The purpose of cohort calls is two-fold. Firstly, Outreachy interns have their
own projects to focus on, which may not overlap with one another. The cohort
call provides a safe space for them to interact, ask each other questions, and
help each other out.

Secondly, the cohort call provides a space to teach the interns about more
broader open science/open source concepts and the transferable skills that
come with them, such as code review.

## How to run a cohort call

Cohort calls happen once a month for the during of the internship (3 calls in
total) and should last an hour. They include some tasks, a mix of collaborative
and silent writing, for the interns to complete.

- Ask the interns to complete some kind of scheduling poll
  ([Doodle](https://doodle.com/), [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/), etc)
  to ascertain a time for the call
- Prepare a collaborative document ([HackMD](https://hackmd.io/),
  [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/), etc) before the call with the topic
  and tasks (see the next section for templates)
- Always start the call with a reminder of the Code of Conduct, and who the
  interns should reach out to in case of a problem
- Always end the call with an open Q&A session when possible
- Use a timer to manage the time spent on the tasks (e.g.
  [cuckoo.team](https://cuckoo.team/))
