# Funding

Outreachy internships are _paid_ internships and a requirement of participating
is that we find the money to [fund at least one intern](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#funding-requirements).
There are different approaches we can take here.

## Outreachy funds: Open Science and General

Outreachy itself has some funding to pay interns in the form of its
[General fund](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#funding-during-cfp)
and [Open Science fund, backed by CZI](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#open-science-funding).
[Eligible communities](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#community-types)
are able to apply for funding for at least one intern via Outreachy from one of
these sources.

```{warning}
As a large open source project with a lot of social capital within the data
science world, we should be mindful not to abuse these funding options where
possible and instead save this space for under-resourced communities.
```

## Grant writing

```{note}
As a primarily volunteer-based community, it can be difficult for anyone of us
to regularly participate in the time-consuming efforts of grant writing. When
such an opportunity does present itself, it is encouraged to think about whether
including Outreachy and additional funding (suggested below) would provide
a strategic benefit to the overall grant.
```

The other way to fund an intern is to bring the money ourselves, which in
JupyterHub's case, is likely in the form of a grant. Alongside the listed salary
of an Outreachy intern, we should consider budgeting for the following additional
expenses.

### Paying mentors

Members of our community are very busy and often cannot justify spending more
voluntary time to mentor an intern. While not a whole solution to this
problem, those who are able to accept payment should be recompensed fairly
for their time.

Outreachy sets out expected working hours per week throughout the various stages
of the process in their [mentor documentation](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#mentor)
and this can be used to calculate a fair salary for mentors.

### Discretionary fund

A discretionary fund to cover related expenses is also advised. Some line items
that could be covered by this fund include:

- **[](partners:ols:mentor-training):** Roughly between $500-$1000
- **Mentor honoraria:** If it is not within the scope of the grant to also pay
  mentors, or the mentors are unable to accept formal payment, then some
  budget for honoraria to thank them for their time and expertise is
  encouraged. An example of how mentor honoraria have been distributed in
  [](partners:ols) is offering a choice between:
  - A ~$50 face value gift voucher for a store such as
    [Red Bubble](https://www.redbubble.com/), or
  - [Planting a tree](https://tree-nation.com/) in their name
- **Contracting folk to answer questions during the
  [contribution period](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#contribution-period):**
  The contribution period is _intense_ and Outreachy has a few tips to
  [avoid burnout](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#avoiding-mentor-burnout-during-contribution-period)
  during this period. Rather than solely relying on volunteers other than the
  mentors, we could also budget to pay some people for their time to help
  during this period.

## Additional interns

Sometimes mentors find themselves in the position of having more strong intern
candidates than they have funding for. In that case, it is possible to apply
to Outreachy for [additional intern funding](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#partial-general-funding).
