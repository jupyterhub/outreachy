# Partnerships

To build out content and processes for this guide, previous Community Coordinators
have worked closely with other organisations doing similar work/programmes to
learn about their best practices and develop them for the JupyterHub community's
benefit. We also often share resources with them. These partnerships are
detailed below.

## Open Life Science

[Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/) are an organisation
providing their own mentorship programme within their own right, but also
have a wealth of experience with the Outreachy programme and hosting interns.
During the compilation of these guides, we have learned a lot from their
expertise and reference their documentation where appropriate. We thank them,
and especially [Yo Yehudi](https://yo-yehudi.com/), for their generous sharing.

### Mentor training

One major way that we partner with OLS is providing training for mentors prior
to the Outreachy internship period.

This training is organised by OLS and delivered by [360 Training](https://360training.co.uk/).
Scheduling usually happens around the kick-off of an OLS cohort (which usually
occur twice a year). Three timeslots are usually provided and participating
JupyterHub mentors are welcome to attend any of the timeslots that work best
for them. In terms of billing, JupyterHub would pay for one of these sessions
from a discretionary fund associated with the Outreachy round. Or JupyterHub
may share this expense with a sister organisation of OLS,
[Open Hardware Makers](https://openhardware.space/), who also partner with
OLS to train their mentors.

A Community Coordinator can organise this shared training by [contacting the
OLS team](mailto:team@openlifesci.org).
