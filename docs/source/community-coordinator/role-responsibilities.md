## Role

```{seealso}
Outreachy provide an overview of this role and its resposibilities on
[their website](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/)
```

The role of the Community Coordinator is to oversee the Outreachy round. This
includes a lot of organisational skill and the ability to recruit and inspire
volunteers to act as mentors and community volunteers.

## Responsibilities

This section covers the responsibilities of the Community Coordinator and is
presented as a timeline over the course of an Outreachy round.

### Before the round

- Ensure that the community has [](funding) to support any interns (minimum one)
- Recruit volunteers to mentor and help them shape
  [project proposals](proposing-projects) where necessary
- [Register the community to participate in Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/)
- Ensure all mentors have write access to the
  [`jupyterhub/outreachy` repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy)

### Approving mentors and projects

- When the mentors submit their project proposals, the Community Coordinator
  will need to approve them on the Outreachy platform. There will be an email
  notification with details on accomplishing this.

### Before the contribution period begins

- Assist the mentors in scoping [microtasks](microtasks) where necessary
- Ensure clear lines of communication, such as:
  - Defining a single gitter channel, Discourse thread, email, etc as a point of
    contact
  - Ensure any links provided by on the project proposals are not broken and
    point to the intended destination
  - Consider almagamating microtasks for a specific project into a landing page
    for the interns to avoid confusion
- Recruit Community Volunteers to help mentors answer questions in the
  defined communication channels
  - To recruit volunteers, you can use
    [this template text](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/HEAD/markdown-templates/call-to-action-contribution-period.md)
    to make posts on [Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org) and the
    [Team Compass](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass)
- Ensure all mentors and community volunteers are added to the appropriate
  communication channels

### During the contribution period

- Ensure all community volunteers and mentors are supported in answering
  questions and reviewing contributions from the applicants
- Organise and [](contrib:during:q&a)
  - Post the discussion notes from this session on Discourse and ensure
    applicants are aware of its location
- Organise and [](contrib:during:sync-up) for the mentors
  - As a result of this meeting, mentors may decide to close some projects to
    new contributors, which can be accomplished through the Outreachy platform

### After the contribution period closes

- Help with the [clean-up process](contrib:after:clean-up) where able
- Organise and [](contrib:after:retrospective) with the mentors and community
  volunteers
  - This can help improve the contribution period for the next round
- Facilitate the [applicant review process](review-apps) where needed
- Once the mentors have selected their interns, you will need to assign a source
  of funding for them in the Outreachy platform
  - If you have identified more talented interns than funded spots, this is also
    when you can apply to Outreachy for [additional funding](funding:additional)

### Before the interns begin

- Create some meeting notes documents for the mentor-intern pairs using the
  [template](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/HEAD/markdown-templates/meeting-notes-template.md).
- Introduce each interns to their mentor and set some ground rules using
  [this email template](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/markdown-templates/intern-intro-email-template.md)
- If a member of the community is able to volunteer, also organise an
  introduction/demo session for the interns. See a previous example of such a
  session [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhMHMuwphc0).

### During the internships

- Ensure mentors are submitting feedback for their interns
  - This can be [tracked in an issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/issues/146)
- Be available to discuss any issues with mentors and/or interns and involve
  the Outreachy organisers if necessary
- Optionally, run [](cohort-calls)

### After the internships

- Organise [honoraria for the mentors](funding:discretionary)
- Request [testimonials from the interns](https://jupyterhub-outreachy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interns/become.html)
  to place on the website
- Add folk who participated (interns, mentors and yourself!) to the lists of
  previous participants
