## Testimonals

Here are some testimonials from previous Outreachy interns who have worked with
JupyterHub.

> Participating in an Outreachy internship at Project JupyterHub was one of the
> best decisions I've made for my career as a software developer. Working with
> the JupyterHub community on Pytest JupyterHub taught me the importance of
> community building and collaboration, and helped me establish lasting
> friendships with some of the brightest minds in the industry. The experience
> pushed me to expand my skill set and solidified my passion for open-source
> development. I couldn't have hoped for a more rewarding and fulfilling
> internship, and I'm grateful for the opportunity that Outreachy and Project
> JupyterHub provided me.

> When I started my internship with JupyterHub, the last thing I expected was to
> have a great time. In fact, I was very afraid: what if I fail? What if I am not
> good enough and the mentors call me out, or worse, rate me poorly? What if...
> what if? But my fears were unfounded. The first words my mentor and our
> cohort’s community coordinator, Dr. Sarah Gibson, would say in our introductory
> call were that there would be no “fail” score in her assessment of our work and
> that we can rest assured that she would not give negative feedback about us to
> the Outreachy organizers. This reassurance calmed me and I began to see the
> internship for what it really was: an opportunity to meaningfully contribute,
> learn as much as possible, and collaborate with others on a spectacular open
> source software project. Over three months, and with the consistent support and
> encouragement of Sarah and other JupyterHub contributors, especially Min,
> Georgiana, Erik, and Simon Li, I managed to successfully achieve my
> internship’s objective: restructuring JupyterHub’s documentation using the
> Diataxis framework. I will always be grateful for the lessons I learned, the
> experiences I had, and the people I met during this period.

> During a Coffee chat organised by Outreachy for the May cohort applicants, I
> was asked to use three words to summarise my Outreachy experience using three
> words. After thinking for a while, I had to resort to describing my experience
> because I felt three words weren't enough. Being able to intern with JupyterHub
> is what I would describe as a life-changing opportunity. In the space of three
> months, I went from doubting my technical skills, being scared of initiating
> conversations and asking questions to being confident. Right now, I might not
> know everything but I have the right attitude to learn ANYTHING I set my heart
> to because of how present, helpful and supportive my mentors and members of the
> JupyterHub community are. During my internship they answered all my questions,
> pointed me to the right resources to learn and even created time for pair
> programming sessions when I got stuck. This has improved both my technical
> skills and interpersonal skills. I am grateful for this and hope one day, I
> will be able to pour the knowledge I have gained into others.
