# List of Current Microtasks Available

```{warning}
This table will only update when we rebuild the docs. See
<https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/issues/157> for strategies to rectify
this.

% NOTE: The CSV files used by this page are generated by the script located at
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/scripts/get-repo-issues.py
% The above script is automatically run on issue opened/closed/(un)labeled
% events by a GitHub Actions workflow located at
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-issues.yaml
% The CSV files are then committed and pushed to the issue-data branch of the repo
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/tree/issue-data

This table shows the microtasks currently available to work on during a
contribution period. The table contains a link to the issue describing the
task, a label indicating which project it is connected to, an indication of
how many applicants can work on the issue simultaneously, and a label indicating
the difficulty level of the task.
