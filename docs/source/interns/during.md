# During the Internship

Congratulations! You have been selected to complete an internship with
JupyterHub! This page describes what you can expect to happen next.

## Welcome!

Welcome to the community! Before the first week of the internship, you should
receive an email from the [Community Coordinator](comm-coord) introducing you
to your mentor, explaining how to setup a recurring meeting with them, along
with other norms of JupyterHub, such as: our Code of Conduct and who to report
to if there is a need, the social channels we use to communicate, etc.

## Meetings with your mentor

You will be asked to setup regular, recurring meetings with your mentor for the
duration of the internship. Once a week for 30 minutes is a good starting point,
but you can adjust as you and your mentor see fit.

Remember, you and your mentor are likely to be in different timezones! So try to
suggest times that are workable but respectful. For instance, try to avoid first
thing in morning, last thing at night, and lunchtimes - unless you've been
explicitly told that it's ok!

## Communicating with your fellow interns

For groups of interns working simultaneously with JupyterHub, there is a
dedicated gitter channel where you can ask each other questions and help each
other.

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/outreachy](https://badges.gitter.im/jupyterhub/outreachy.svg)](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/outreachy?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Feedback

You will be asked to provide feedback to Outreachy at set points throughout the
course of your internship. This is for Outreachy to check that you are getting
the support you need, and to help improve the overall programme. Your mentors
will not see what you have written. They will be providing their own feedback.

## Extending your internship

If necessary and agreed upon by your mentors and the Outreachy organisers, your
internship may be extended in order to help you complete the project. **Note that
you will not be paid extra for this extension and your final stipend from Outreachy
will be delayed.** This is a big decision that no one will make lightly, and it
will only be used if absolutely necessary.

## (Optional) Cohort calls

You may also be invited to participate in [](cohort-calls). These are calls designed
to bring you and other interns working on JupyterHub together to collaborate and
learn about more broader aspects of open source, such as code review.

These calls will be scheduled with you in advance by the
[Community Coordinator](comm-coord).
