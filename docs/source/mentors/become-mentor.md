# Become a Mentor

This section outlines the benefits of becoming a mentor as well as the
expectations and responsibilities you will have while mentoring with Outreachy.

Where possible, we aim to provide [training](partners:ols:mentor-training) for
our mentors via our partnership with [](partners:ols).

## Why you should become a mentor

If you think back on positive experiences of joining open source projects, you
will probably find that the reason that experience was positive is because
someone else in the community took the time to onboard you. This was a form of
mentorship. Many of those who mentor feel an altruistic responsibility to help
people who are struggling along similar paths to those that the mentor once did,
especially if they received mentorship through that experience. Mentoring is also
a way that we can scale positive change in the world. For instance, if we care
about more people working openly, then those people need help in learning how to
do that, and a mentor can be the person who provides that help.

As well as altruism, there are also personal, professional development reasons
to pursue mentoring. Being a mentor is one way to develop and demonstrate the
people skills often required in management roles. Mentoring through Outreachy
specifically also provides some line management experience, since the mentors
design the projects for the interns and are responsible for them progressing
through and completing the work.

## Expectations of mentors

```{seealso}
Outreachy document the full responsibilities and expectations of participating
mentors, including time commitments, on their website
[here](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/) and [here](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#mentor-expectations)
```

The main expectations of mentors are:

- To scope an appropriate project for an intern to complete over 13 weeks
- To scope appropriate ["microtasks"](microtasks) for applicants to complete
  during the [contribution period](contribution-period)
- Engage with applicants and answer questions/offer guidance during the
  contribution period
- Mentor the intern through your proposed project for the 13 week internship
  duration
- Provide feedback to Outreachy regarding the intern's performance

## Pair mentoring

We strongly advocate for pair-mentoring a project where possible. This can
reduce the load on mentors, provide a new mentor with support and guidance,
and cover extenuating circumstances if one mentor needs to step back for
whatever reason.

## How to sign up to mentor
